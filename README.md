Use of original art

Scope reduction -  the absolute minimum number of sprites, backgrounds, etc. your game needs to work,

## 9.  All the audio assets
Sall the audio assets (effects, music tracks, etc.) that your game needs
Overall aesthetic of the game and what purpose (feedback, narrative, aesthetic, etc.) each asset serves.
Create the assets and integrate them in the prototype

## 10.  Playtest

# #AboutAssets

All assets are original. Please let me know if you want to download it.

# #FurtherContributionsAndCurrentBugs
- Already selected options could perhaps disappear.
- The characters would require a bit more polish (the door has 6 different shades while the characters have 3).
- Very accessible by offering so many options, but a bit unorganized (it's overwhelming to see a page with settings that are not that obviously structured).
- The scope goes beyond what is manageable in a smaller project.
